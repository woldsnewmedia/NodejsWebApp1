myutils.js contains util functions
mssql1.js and mysql1.js are sql server and mysql connection / loop tests
server1.js is a site server test thing.  (Note - i had to npm install ejs and also add it to package.json)


visual studio - right click on an ejs file, open with, select "HTML (Web Forms) Editor" (set as Default) - allows syntax highlight/i'sense etc
* I think routes are like controllers (?)
